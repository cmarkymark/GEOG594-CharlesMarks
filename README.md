### My definiton of Big Data is information that humans are only able to collect, analyze, and understand through the use of technological solutions.  It is information that humans do not have the capacity to access without technological assistance, whether due to the information itself being too complex for a human to interpret or because collecting the information itself would be too complex a task.
